:::{prf:example} Example: Sharing Tutorials
Importing a data-science tutorial on how to access a dataset in CryoCloud. The only way we have to do this today is with copy-paste and a text link that you hopefully remember, and maybe manually checking for updates when you have time.

These are practical examples of working outside of the scientific collaboration ecosystem, where there is no ability to propagate attribution, updates, versions or credit. The failure of our lack of infrastructure for sharing means that there is no opportunity or incentive to improve and _iterate in place_ on an idea, every person who wants to include one of these tutorials for their community, course, or supplementary materials must also copy/paste the content and then start out on their own.

:::{prf:example} Example: Seminars and Workshops
SimPEG seminar hosted weekly (e.g. [here](https://seminars.simpeg.xyz/seminars/2022-04-cockett)), can be a way to showcase scholarly content in a more professional way, and have DOIs land on pages that are designed for the work and showcase it integrated to your other content.
