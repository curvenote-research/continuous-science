## Infrastructure for Working

There is a role for a new position whose job is the cultural and behavioral influencers, who align the system who improve the speed by changing the process of science. There is a similar roles that we can map out as dev-ops, on good team structures and anti-patterns (see [devops topologies](https://web.devopstopologies.com)) - some of these conversations are ongoing as the role of a Research Software Engineer, and in organizations that are external service providers to communities.

**Need it be open?** Continuous science need not be open, or fully transparent as the work is ongoing. Small groups of trusted collaborators or a community with enforced social norms are places where individuals can take risks and try out ideas. Transitioning from that private collaboration into a open-science-spaces, however, should be seamless.

## Networked Science (Working across the puzzle pieces)

- What do the imports look like across communities?
- How do we bring computation and content into my community infrastructure?

> “We see a future in which scientific information and scholarly communication more generally become part of a global, universal and explicit network of knowledge; where every claim, hypothesis, argument—every significant element of the discourse—can be explicitly represented, along with supporting data, software, workflows, multimedia, external commentary, and information about provenance.”
>
> “This vision moves away from the paper-centric model of the scholarly literature, towards a more distributed network-centric model” that “vastly improves knowledge transfer and [has a] far wider impact.”

Too much peer review.

- Getting the review at the right time.

Prestige model

- That is a big problem.
- Pay for prestige.

Earlier then you get the feedback.

Just the productivity side?

- The need for standardization
- Standard metrics for accomplishments

It is a continuum.

Early adoption:

- want 1% of users.
- intersection between open-source / open-science

## Outline on comparing

- Open-source
  - Legal
  - Technical
  - Social
- Organizationally
  - Smaller
  - Automated
  - Continuous
